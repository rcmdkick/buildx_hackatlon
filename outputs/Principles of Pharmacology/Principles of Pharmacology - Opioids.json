            "question": "What characterizes opioid agonists?",
            "goodAnswer": "Opioid agonists have high affinity and activity at opioid receptors to provide analgesia.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Opioid agonists only block opioid receptors and prevent any response.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Opioid agonists have no effect on any receptor types.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "Agonists decrease the synthesis of enkephalins in the body.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "Agonists work by stimulating the metabolism of codeine."

            "goodAnswer": "Enkephalins are endogenous opioids that modulate neurotransmitter release and are selective for δ receptors.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Enkephalins are dietary supplements with no role in neurotransmitter modulation.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "They are synthetic drugs that inhibit all neurotransmitter activity.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "Enkephalins are enzymes that degrade neurotransmitters.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "They serve solely as structural proteins in neurons."

          {
            "question": "Which endogenous opioid peptide is derived from proopiomelanocortin (POMC)?",
            "goodAnswer": "Endorphins, chiefly β-endorphin, are derived from POMC.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Only enkephalins are derived from POMC.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Dynorphins are solely derived from POMC.",

            "question": "How do opioids produce analgesic effects in the central nervous system?",
            "goodAnswer": "Opioids inhibit adenylyl cyclase, modulate receptor-ion interactions, and alter neurotransmitter release specific to pain pathways.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Opioids enhance serotonin uptake exclusively to provide analgesia.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "They act solely by causing vasoconstriction in the brain.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "Opioids increase the production of adrenaline to relieve pain.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "They work by directly stimulating pain receptors."

            "wrongAnswer_1": "Adenylyl cyclase is stimulated by opioids to enhance pain transmission.",

            "wrongAnswer_3": "Adenylyl cyclase causes vasodilation in response to opioids.",

            "wrongAnswer_1": "Naloxone binds with high affinity to blood lipids, enhancing opioid effects.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Naloxone only binds to δ receptors and enhances opioid analgesia.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "Naloxone promotes the production of more endogenous opioids in the body.",
