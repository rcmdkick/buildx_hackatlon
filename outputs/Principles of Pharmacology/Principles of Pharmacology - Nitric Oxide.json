            "question": "How is nitric oxide (NO) synthesized in vascular endothelial cells?",
            "goodAnswer": "NO is synthesized from the terminal guanidine nitrogen of L-arginine and diffuses into vascular smooth muscle.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "NO is synthesized from carbon dioxide and water in vascular endothelial cells.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "NO is directly absorbed from the surrounding atmosphere by vascular endothelial cells.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "NO is synthesized from the terminal guanidine nitrogen of L-lysine in the liver.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "NO is synthesized through the cyclooxygenase pathway in vascular endothelial cells."

            "question": "What role does nitric oxide (NO) play in the pulmonary vasculature?",
            "goodAnswer": "NO causes relaxation of pulmonary vascular smooth muscle, reducing pulmonary hypertension.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "NO causes contraction of pulmonary vascular smooth muscle, increasing pulmonary hypertension.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "NO causes oxidation of pulmonary endothelial cells, leading to increased vascular resistance.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "NO inhibits gas exchange in the alveoli, resulting in reduced oxygen uptake.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "NO binds to hemoglobin, reducing oxygen transport capacity."

          {
            "question": "In ARDS, how does inhaled nitric oxide (NO) improve arterial oxygenation?",
            "goodAnswer": "Inhaled NO improves ventilation-perfusion matching by causing selective vasodilation in well-ventilated lung regions.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Inhaled NO reduces oxygen consumption in body tissues, thereby increasing arterial oxygenation.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Inhaled NO increases the solubility of oxygen in plasma, enhancing oxygen delivery to tissues.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "Inhaled NO directly increases the production of red blood cells, improving oxygen transport.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "Inhaled NO binds with carbon dioxide, reducing the respiratory stimulus and enhancing oxygen levels."

          {
            "question": "Why is inhaled nitric oxide (NO) preferred over intravenous vasodilators in ARDS?",
            "goodAnswer": "Inhaled NO does not produce systemic vasodilation and specifically targets ventilated alveoli.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Inhaled NO is cheaper and easier to administer than intravenous vasodilators.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Inhaled NO causes sustained systemic effects, unlike intravenous vasodilators.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "Inhaled NO increases overall vascular resistance, unlike intravenous vasodilators.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "Inhaled NO is less effective than intravenous vasodilators but has fewer side effects."

            "question": "How does inhaled nitric oxide (NO) therapy benefit infants with persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN)?",
            "goodAnswer": "Inhaled NO reduces pulmonary vascular resistance, improving systemic arterial oxygenation.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Inhaled NO increases systemic blood pressure, indirectly stimulating lung function.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Inhaled NO directly improves the muscle strength of the diaphragm, enhancing breathing.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "Inhaled NO acts as a bronchodilator, opening airways in the upper respiratory tract.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "Inhaled NO promotes surfactant production, thereby increasing lung compliance."

            "wrongAnswer_2": "Inhaled NO increases metabolic rate, thereby heightening oxygen demand.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "Inhaled NO increases heart rate, which improves oxygen delivery across the body.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "Inhaled NO exerts a strong immunosuppressive effect, reducing neonatal infections."
