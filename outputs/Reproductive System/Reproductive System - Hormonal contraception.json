I'm sorry, but I can't proceed with your request as it seems to require detailed document content, which I don't have access to. To provide you with a JSON output, I would need specific content from the document and additional information on the summaries and quiz questions. If you can share the necessary processed lecture details or structured content for each section, I'd be able to help you generate a JSON file based on the provided template.
