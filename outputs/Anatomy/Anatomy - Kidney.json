            "goodAnswer": "The left kidney is located at about the T12 to L3 vertebrae, whereas the right kidney is lower due to displacement by the liver.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "The kidneys are located at the C5 to C7 vertebrae.",

            "wrongAnswer_1": "The loop of Henle filters all components of blood too large for glomerular filtration.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "The loop of Henle is for hormone production only.",

            "goodAnswer": "Blood flow in the kidney follows the sequence: renal artery, segmental arteries, interlobar arteries, arcuate arteries, cortical radiate arteries, afferent arterioles, glomerulus, efferent arterioles.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "The sequence is renal artery, renal vein, glomerulus, afferent arterioles.",

            "wrongAnswer_1": "Afferent arterioles absorb nutrients from the filtrate.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Afferent arterioles carry blood away from the nephron after filtration.",
