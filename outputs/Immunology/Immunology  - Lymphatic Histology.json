I'm sorry, but as a text-based assistant, I'm unable to process PDF documents directly in real-time. However, I can help guide you through the process of creating the JSON file based on the steps you've provided. If you can provide the specific content from the lecture text (i.e., the raw text that has been extracted and preprocessed), I'd be glad to assist you further.
