            "wrongAnswer_2": "Mechanoreceptors only respond to temperature changes, not chewing movements",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "They inhibit saliva production to prevent excessive fluid loss during eating",

            "wrongAnswer_2": "Taste buds detect flavors independently, and saliva plays no role in the process",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "Saliva only lubricates food and does not interact with taste receptors",

            "question": "How does dehydration affect saliva production?",
            "goodAnswer": "It reduces saliva flow, leading to dry mouth​",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Dehydration increases saliva production to compensate for fluid loss",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Saliva production remains constant regardless of hydration levels",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "Dehydration makes saliva more watery to aid in swallowing",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "Saliva flow increases during dehydration to maintain oral pH balance"
