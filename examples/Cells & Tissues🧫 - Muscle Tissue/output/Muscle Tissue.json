Smooth muscles consist of cardiac muscles which have involuntary vigorous and rhythmic action and smooth muscle itself which have involuntary slow and long lasting function. ",

Striated muscles consist of skeletal and cardiac muscle while smooth muscle is found in internal organs and blood vessels. "

            "wrongAnswer_1": "T tubules are transverse tubules that run perpendicular to myofibrils and induce Ca absorption in the muscle fibers, causing repolarization which stimulates the propagation of contractory signals. ",

            "wrongAnswer_2": "Skeletal muscles contract due to the sliding of microtubules within muscle fibers, which occurs because of a chemical reaction between the muscle fibers and microtubules. When many microtubules slide within, gross movement results. ",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "Skeletal muscle fibers expand and contract by the absorption and release of calcium, which causes the thick and thin filaments to rotate around their own axis resulting in gross movement. ",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "Skeletal muscle fibers contract by the interaction between protein molecules within T tubules that form temporary bonds, which then break and reform in a synchronized manner. This cyclical process of breaking and reforming results in a visible shortening and lengthening of muscle fibers. "

            "wrongAnswer_1": "At the neuromuscular junction, norepinephrine is released into the synaptic cleft and binds to calcium channel receptors on the muscle fiber. This binding initiates a chemical reaction in the muscle fiber which propagates to cause overall skeletal muscle contraction.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "At the neuromuscular junction, glutamate is released into the synaptic cleft and binds to magnesium channel receptors on the muscle fiber. This binding process initiates an action potential in the sarcolemma of the muscle cell, resulting in muscle contraction.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "The release of dopamine from the axon terminal into the synaptic cleft causes an influx of calcium, resulting in depolarization of the muscle fiber. This depolarization initiates an action potential in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. ",

            "question": "What does the release of Ca from the sarcoplasmic reticulum induce?",
            "goodAnswer": "TnC binds Ca and induces the release of TnI from actin, which results in the binding of myosin to actin. This induces a power stroke in which the myosin heads pivot and actin filaments are pulled towards the center of the sarcomere. This action shortens the sarcomere and leads to muscle contraction.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "The calcium released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum causes Tnl to bind to TnC which prevents the myosin heads from pivoting and the actin filaments from moving. This results in the inhibition of a power stroke and the actin filaments remain stationary. This action maintains the sarcomere length and prevents muscle contraction.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Tnl binds Ca and induces the release of TnC from myosin, which results in the binding of actin to myosin. This induces a power stroke where the actin heads pivot and myosin filaments are pulled towards the center of the sarcomere. This action shortens the sarcomere and leads to muscle contraction",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "Ca released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum activates TnT, which binds to tropomyosin and promotes the binding of myosin to actin. This activates the power stroke, and the myosin heads pivot while the actin filaments are pushed towards the center of the sarcomere. This action shortens the sarcomere and leads to muscle contraction.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "TnC secreted from the sarcoplasmic reticulum induces the binding of tropomyosin to actin, which inhibits the binding of myosin to actin. This forces the myosin heads to remain stationary. As a result, actin filaments are pushed towards the periphery of the sarcomere. This action lengthens the sarcomere and leads to muscle relaxation."

            "wrongAnswer_2": "Two types of cells come together to form smooth muscle -- cuboidal and striated. Each cell contains a single, peripherally-located nucleus. These muscle cells contract through direct electrical stimulation and are predominantly present in the spinal cord, pancreas, and lungs.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "Smooth muscle consists of groups of irregularly shaped cells with a non-striated appearance. All cells have several nuclei scattered throughout. Muscle contraction is solely hormone-induced. This muscle type is located in the heart, brain, and lymphatic vessels.",
