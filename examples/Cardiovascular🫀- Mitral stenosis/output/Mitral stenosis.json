The informations about the different topics listed on the ppt pages are sometimes limited and do not contain the necessary amount of content because of it's dense format, therefore it does not include every information but serves as a great foundation to form the questions and provide focus on core content, however additional background knowledge is needed to create quality revision quizzes.",

            "question": "What is the stenotic process in mitral stenosis?",
            "goodAnswer": "Scarring and fibrosis of leaflets and chordae tendineae, which causes a commissural fusion. This leads to funnel-shaped orifice and pressure gradient across the valve.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "The total stroke volume increases, so more blood is pumped from the left ventricle to the left atrium. This leads to a ventricular remodelling, so the left ventricle enlarges.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "A specific mutation in the COL2A gen causes an error in the folding of collagen. This leads to an incorrect formation of the mitral valve and thus creating a funnel shaped orifice and pressure gradient across the valve.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "Due to a bacterial endocarditis, the valves are damaged by the pathogens. This leads to the changes on the surface of the valve, the outcome is the narrowing of the intervalvular space.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "It only occurs in people with a congenital bicuspidal mitral valve. In this case, instead of 3, there are 2 leaflets, which causes the narrowing of the intervalvular space."
