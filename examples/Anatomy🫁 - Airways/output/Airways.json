            "goodAnswer": "Serving as a passageway for both air and food, the oropharynx is bordered superiorly by the nasopharynx and anteriorly by the oral cavity. The fauces form the opening between the oral cavity and the oropharynx. It contains the palatine and lingual tonsils, which are lymphoid tissues that trap and destroy pathogens.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "The oropharynx is a muscular chamber positioned between the nasall cavity and the nasopharynx, serving as a conduit for both respiration and digestion. It is lined with stratified squamous epithelium, which protects against mechanical stress. The fauces, located at its anterior boundary, control the passage of food and air into the next section of the pharynx.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "The structure responsible for filtering air before it enters the lungs is the oropharynx. It is bordered superiorly by the esophagus and anteriorly by the larynx. The fauces direct airflow into the nasal cavity, and it contains the pharyngeal and lingual tonsils, which function mainly in mucus production.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "The oropharynx transports food from the oral cavity directly to the esophagus. It is lined entirely with pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium. The fauces regulate digestion, and it contains only the palatine tonsils, which secrete enzymes to break down ingested particles.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "The tube of connective tissue that separates the respiratory and digestive pathways is called the oropharynx. It is bordered laterally by the nasopharynx and inferiorly by the esophagus. The fauces prevent food from entering the larynx, and it contains the lingual tonsil, which facilitate saliva production."

            "question": "How is the laryngopharynx positioned within the pharynx, and what is its function?",
            "goodAnswer": "The laryngopharynx is inferior to the oropharynx and posterior to the larynx. It serves as a passage for both air and ingested material until the inferior end, where the digestive and respiratory systems diverge. Anteriorly, it opens into the larynx, and posteriorly, it enters the esophagus.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Found above the trachea and behind the nasal cavity, the laryngopharynx can be seen as a continuation of the laryngeal airway. It primarily aids in sound production and contains vocal cords responsible for phonation.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "The muscular tube extending from the nasal cavity to the trachea is called the laryngopharynx. It primarily filters incoming air, preventing dust and debris from reaching the lungs, while allowing food to pass freely into the stomach.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "The laryngopharynx has a similar role as the esophagus, acting as a junction for air and swallowed substances. It extends downward, allowing food to pass anteriorly into the stomach while guiding air posteriorly into the lungs. This dual-function passage ensures separation of respiratory and digestive pathways.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "Incomplete separation of the larynx and the pharynx leads to the laryngopharynx. In these cases, both air and food will enter the trachea. Vocal cords, which are located at the center part of the laryngopharynx, remain intact, allowing proper sound production."

            "wrongAnswer_3": "The larynx is a passageway that connects the trachea to the lungs It primarily functions as a resonance chamber for voice production rather than air regulation. It is composed of multiple cartilage plates and fibrous tissue.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "The larynx is a muscular organ that links the respiratory and digestive systems. It is found at the junction of the laryngopharynx and esophagus and plays a key role in vocalization.

            "question": "What are the characterstics of the glottis?",
            "goodAnswer": "The glottis is composed of the vestibular folds, the true vocal cords, and the space between these folds. The vestibular folds, also called false vocal cords, are folded sections of mucous membrane. The true vocal cords are white, membranous folds attached by muscle to the thyroid and arytenoid cartilages.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "The cartilage that connects the larynx to the trachea is the glottis. It is formed by the epiglottis, vestibular folds, and vocal cords. The vestibular folds are muscular bands that adjust tension in the airway, while the true vocal cords are cartilage-supported structures that alter the pitch of the voice.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "The glottis is a structure located between the cricoid and thyroid cartilages and is made up of the vocal cords, vestibular folds, and a surrounding membrane. The vestibular folds play a primary role in closing off the airway, rather than producing sound. The true vocal cords assist in directing airflow into the trachea.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "The glottis includes the vestibular folds, the vocal ligaments, and the arytenoid cartilages. The vestibular folds contain ciliated epithelium to filter air before it enters the lungs, while the true vocal cords produce sound by vibrating against the cricoid cartilage.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "The opening between the larynx and the pharynx is called the glottis. It contains the vestibular folds, which prevent food from entering the trachea, while the true vocal cords expand and contract to regulate phonation and control the width of the airway ."

            "goodAnswer": "The trachea branches into the right and left primary bronchi. They enter the lungs at the hilum along with blood vessels, lymphatic vessels, and nerves. Rings of cartilage support the structure of the bronchi and prevent their collapse.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Air from the trachea is directed into the right and left primary bronchi, which enter the pleural cavity along with arteries and veins. These bronchi are encased in smooth muscle fibers, which help adjust their diameter and regulate airflow.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "The airway divides into superior and inferior bronchi, which carry oxygen directly to the alveoli. These bronchi pass through the diaphragm and are reinforced by loose connective tissue rings, which allow them to expand and contract, regulating airflow into the lungs.",

            "wrongAnswer_3": "Branching from the trachea into separate airway pathways, each bronchial tree supplies individual lung lobes. Unlike other parts of the respiratory system, its bronchi are lined with fibrous connective tissue rather than a mucous membrane, which allows for structural support.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "The bronchial tree is a system of small air passages that branch from the alveolar sacs toward the trachea. It provides structural support for the lungs and assists in warming inhaled air, while its inner lining absorbs excess carbon dioxide before exhalation."

Their walls contain both smooth muscle fibers and cartilage, which control air pressure and regulate oxygen and carbon dioxide diffusion into the bloodstream.",

An alveolus is approximately 200 μm in diameter with elastic walls that allow the alveolus to stretch during air intake. Alveoli are connected to their neighbors by alveolar pores, which help maintain equal air pressure throughout the alveoli.",

Each alveolus is about 500 μm in diameter, with rigid walls that do not expand. Alveolar pores control how much oxygen is absorbed in different lung regions.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Consisting multiple alveoli, alveolar sacs serve as air reservoirs. An alveolus is approximately 100 μm in diameter and is reinforced with connective tissue to stabilize its shape. Alveoli are connected by alveolar pores, which regulate airflow into the bronchi.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "Each alveolar sac is a hollow chamber that temporarily holds air before it reaches the alveoli. The alveoli themselves measure around 300 μm in diameter and have thick muscular walls that actively contract, helping to push air into the bloodstream. Alveolar pores adjust lung volume to accommodate changing respiratory needs.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "An alveolar sac is a flexible airway structure that expands and contracts with respiration. An alveolus is approximately 50 μm in diameter with smooth muscle fibers that control airflow resistance. Alveoli are connected by alveolar pores, which function to regulate ventilation between different lung segments."
