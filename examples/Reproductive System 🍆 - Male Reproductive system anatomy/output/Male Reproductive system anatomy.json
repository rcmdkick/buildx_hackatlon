            "goodAnswer": "Erection can be either reflexively or centrally mediated.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Erection is solely initiated by sympathetic nerve activity.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Erection is initiated by voluntary muscle contraction.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "Erection is only initiated by direct stimulation of the penis.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "Erection is initiated by parasympathetic nerve activity alone."

          {
            "question": "What happens to the erectile bodies during an erection?",
            "goodAnswer": "Arterial filling increases, leading to venous occlusion of the erectile bodies.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Venous flow increases, leading to a flaccid state.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Arterial flow decreases, causing erectile bodies to shrink.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "Erectile bodies become filled with lymphatic fluid, not blood.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "Sympathetic tone increases, leading to decreased blood flow."

          {
            "question": "What does the flaccid state of the penis involve?",
            "goodAnswer": "It involves resting sympathetic tone, contracted muscles, and small-caliber cavernosal arteries.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "It involves relaxed sympathetic tone and dilated arteries.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "It involves increased blood flow and open venules.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "It involves smooth muscle relaxation and large-caliber arteries.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "It involves increased venous outflow and arterial constriction."

            "question": "How does Viagra (Sildenafil) enhance sexual function?",
            "goodAnswer": "It enhances nitric oxide effects by inhibiting PDE5, which increases cGMP and smooth muscle relaxation.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "It stimulates direct muscle contraction and enhances blood flow.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "It reduces the levels of nitric oxide in the blood vessels.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "It works by blocking the release of guanylate cyclase in the corpus cavernosum.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "It inhibits PDE3, increasing smooth muscle contraction and reducing blood flow."

            "question": "What is a potential side effect of high doses of Viagra?",
            "goodAnswer": "Color vision problems due to the effect on PDE6 in the retina.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Dizziness and difficulty breathing due to increased blood pressure.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Nausea and vomiting due to liver enzyme inhibition.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "Blurred vision from reduced nitric oxide release in the eyes.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "Muscle spasms and weakness due to reduced blood flow to muscles."
