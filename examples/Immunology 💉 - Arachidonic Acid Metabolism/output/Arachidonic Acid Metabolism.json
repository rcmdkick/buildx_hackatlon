            "goodAnswer": "COX-1 is constitutively expressed in most tissues and plays a role in homeostatic functions such as gastric mucosal protection, platelet aggregation (via thromboxane A2), and renal blood flow regulation. COX-2 is inducible and is primarily involved in inflammation, producing prostaglandins (e.g., PGE2, PGI2) that mediate pain, fever, and vasodilation in response to injury.",

            "question": "What are the primary biological functions of cyclooxygenase-derived products, and how do they influence physiological processes?",
            "goodAnswer": "Cyclooxygenase-derived products include prostaglandins (PGE2, PGI2) and thromboxane A2 (TXA2), which regulate vascular tone, platelet function, inflammation, and pain perception. PGE2 and PGI2 promote vasodilation, inhibit platelet aggregation, and modulate immune responses by suppressing cytokine production and mast cell activation. TXA2, produced by platelets, induces vasoconstriction and promotes platelet aggregation, playing a crucial role in hemostasis.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Cyclooxygenase-derived products include prostaglandins (PGE2, PGI2) and thromboxane B2 (TXB2), which regulate vascular tone, platelet function, inflammation, and immune suppression. PGE2 and PGI2 promote vasoconstriction, enhance platelet aggregation, and stimulate immune cell activation by increasing cytokine release and mast cell degranulation. TXB2, produced by platelets, induces vasodilation and inhibits platelet aggregation, reducing the risk of thrombosis.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Cyclooxygenase-derived products include prostaglandins (PGE2, PGI2) and thromboxane A2 (TXA2), which regulate vascular tone, immune function, and neurotransmission. PGE2 and PGI2 promote vasodilation, inhibit platelet aggregation, and stimulate pain receptors, but they also induce bronchoconstriction and reduce renal perfusion. TXA2, produced by neutrophils, plays a key role in inhibiting inflammation and reducing cytokine production.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "Cyclooxygenase-derived products include leukotrienes (LTB4, LTC4, LTD4) and prostacyclin (PGI2), which regulate immune function, pain sensation, and leukocyte recruitment. PGI2 and LTB4 promote vasodilation, platelet aggregation, and neutrophil chemotaxis, while TXA2 suppresses platelet activation and induces bronchodilation. These mediators are essential in controlling inflammatory responses and immune homeostasis.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "Cyclooxygenase-derived products include prostaglandins (PGE2, PGI2) and thromboxane A2 (TXA2), which primarily function in neurotransmission, respiratory regulation, and endocrine balance. PGE2 and PGI2 promote bronchodilation, enhance synaptic signaling, and increase gastric acid secretion, while TXA2 plays a role in immune tolerance and suppressing vascular contraction, reducing the likelihood of clot formation."

            "question": "How do the cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (LOX) pathways differ in their metabolic products and biological functions?",
            "goodAnswer": "The COX pathway converts arachidonic acid into prostaglandins (PGE2, PGI2) and thromboxanes (TXA2), which regulate inflammation, pain, vasodilation, and platelet function. The LOX pathway produces leukotrienes (LTB4, LTC4, LTD4, LTE4), which are mainly involved in neutrophil recruitment, smooth muscle contraction, and increased vascular permeability.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "The COX pathway generates leukotrienes (LTB4, LTC4, LTD4, LTE4), which regulate bronchodilation, platelet inhibition, and immune suppression, while the LOX pathway produces prostaglandins (PGE2, PGI2) and thromboxanes (TXA2), which primarily mediate fever and neurotransmitter release.",

            "wrongAnswer_3": "The COX pathway and LOX pathway both produce thromboxanes and leukotrienes, but COX-derived products mainly function in chemotaxis and degranulation, while LOX-derived products are responsible for platelet aggregation and vascular homeostasis.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "The COX and LOX pathways both generate prostaglandins, thromboxanes, and leukotrienes, but their functions overlap completely, as all arachidonic acid derivatives contribute equally to inflammation, pain regulation, and hemostasis without distinct roles."

            "question": "How does arachidonic acid metabolism contribute to fever production, and what are the key molecular mediators involved?",
            "goodAnswer": "Fever is triggered by endogenous pyrogens such as IL-1 and IL-6, which stimulate COX activity in the hypothalamus. This leads to the conversion of arachidonic acid into prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). PGE2  increases the body's temperature set point, resulting in vasoconstriction, shivering, and heat conservation. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) reduce fever by inhibiting COX, thereby decreasing PGE2 synthesis.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Fever is triggered by exogenous pyrogens such as bacterial endotoxins, which directly activate lipoxygenase (LOX) enzymes in immune cells. This leads to the conversion of arachidonic acid into leukotriene B4 (LTB4), which stimulates vasoconstriction, platelet aggregation, and cytokine release, ultimately increasing the body’s temperature. NSAIDs work by blocking leukotriene synthesis, thereby reducing fever.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Fever occurs when arachidonic acid is converted into thromboxane A2 (TXA2) by COX-2, increasing platelet aggregation and causing heat retention in tissues. TXA2 binds to hypothalamic receptors, leading to a higher thermoregulatory set point. NSAIDs, by inhibiting TXA2 production, prevent fever development and reduce systemic inflammation.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "Fever is caused by arachidonic acid metabolites such as prostacyclin (PGI2) and leukotriene D4 (LTD4), which stimulate the hypothalamus to increase metabolic rate and heat production. PGI2 and LTD4 promote vasodilation and cytokine activation, leading to a rise in temperature. NSAIDs work by blocking LTD4 receptors rather than inhibiting prostaglandin production.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "The production of fever is entirely independent of arachidonic acid metabolism and is solely controlled by hypothalamic neurotransmitters such as dopamine and serotonin. While PGE2 is present in feverish states, it does not play a causal role. Instead, fever is regulated by increased heat production in muscle tissue without involvement of inflammatory mediators. NSAIDs work by blocking serotonin receptors rather than inhibiting COX enzymes."

They also block platelet aggregation and promote vasodilation. In contrast, thromboxane (TXA2) causes vasoconstriction and induces platelet aggregation.",

They promote platelet aggregation and cause vasoconstriction. Thromboxane (TXA2), on the other hand, is responsible for vasodilation and reducing platelet adhesion.",

Thromboxane (TXA2) primarily inhibits platelet aggregation and contributes to vascular permeability.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and prostacyclin (PGI2) reduce immune activation, but their main role is to stimulate platelet adhesion and constrict blood vessels.

By blocking COX-1 and/or COX-2, NSAIDs decrease inflammation, pain, and fever while also affecting platelet function and gastrointestinal protection.",

This eliminates the production of all inflammatory mediators, providing complete pain relief without affecting platelet function or gastrointestinal protection.",

            "goodAnswer": "Aspirin irreversibly inhibits platelet COX, blocking thromboxane A2 (TXA2) production and preventing aggregation. Since platelets lack nuclei, this effect lasts for their lifetime. It also inhibits endothelial prostacyclin (PGI2), but endothelial cells regenerate COX, making this effect temporary.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Aspirin reversibly inhibits COX enzymes in both platelets and endothelial cells, leading to a temporary decrease in thromboxane A2 (TXA2) and prostacyclin (PGI2) levels. Since platelets and endothelial cells can regenerate COX enzymes at the same rate, the effects of aspirin wear off within hours.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Aspirin selectively inhibits COX in endothelial cells while leaving platelet COX unaffected. This results in a sustained reduction of prostacyclin (PGI2) production without altering thromboxane A2 (TXA2) synthesis, leading to increased platelet aggregation over time.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "Aspirin permanently blocks prostacyclin (PGI2) synthesis in endothelial cells while only temporarily reducing thromboxane A2 (TXA2) levels in platelets. Since platelets can rapidly regenerate COX enzymes, their pro-thrombotic activity resumes within hours, making aspirin ineffective in preventing thrombosis.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "Aspirin acts by directly degrading thromboxane A2 (TXA2) molecules in the bloodstream rather than inhibiting COX enzymes. It does not affect endothelial prostacyclin (PGI2) synthesis and has no long-term impact on platelet aggregation."
